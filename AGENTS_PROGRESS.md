* 2025-09-07 / agent: codex-cli
* Phase / Subsystem: Planning / GitHub Issues
* Task: Align issues with architect bundle; add Wi‑Fi networking task
* Summary: Created milestones A–D; created/updated labels (phase, area, type, prio, size). Synced architect issue bundle (#17–#28) and consolidated duplicates by closing older overlapping items (#3–#7) with links. Assigned milestones/labels to remaining seeded issues (#2, #8–#16). Added new "Networking — Integrate external Alfa USB Wi‑Fi as primary" issue (#28).
* Acceptance: Open issues reflect architect structure; duplicates closed and cross‑referenced; preview and sync JSONs under `out/`.
* Evidence: `scripts/sync_issues_from_architect.py`, `out/issues_sync_results.json`.
* Follow-ups: Add assignees/milestones dates as needed; refine labels if architect prefers different taxonomy.

* 2025-09-07 / agent: codex-cli
* Phase / Subsystem: Backlog / Bring-up / Foxglove
* Task: Backlog seeding script; overlay env + controller manager; Foxglove doc polish
* Summary: Added `scripts/seed_issues.py` to parse `docs/ISSUE_BACKLOG.md` and create GitHub issues (requires `GITHUB_TOKEN`), with preview JSON written to `out/issues_seed_preview.json`. Updated bring-up: systemd reads `/etc/default/rover-bringup` for overlay and launch vars; controller manager + spawners added to bringup launch; added `configs/controllers.yaml` + schema and tests. Polished Foxglove doc with step-by-step and topic list.
* Acceptance: Local tests 18 passed; yamllint clean; preview JSON generated for backlog.
* Evidence: Commit `chore(backlog): add scripts/seed_issues.py ...` on `main`.
* Follow-ups: Run issue seeding with `GITHUB_TOKEN` when ready; capture Foxglove screenshot and add to docs.

* Phase / Subsystem: URDF / Control
* Task: Add ros2_control tags + transmissions
* Summary: Inserted `<ros2_control>` system block with velocity command/state interfaces for `left_wheel_joint` and `right_wheel_joint`. Added placeholder `<transmission>` elements to align naming with configs.
* Acceptance: Unit tests still pass (16); linters clean.
* Evidence: Commit `feat(urdf): add ros2_control system/joint interfaces and placeholder transmissions to match diff_drive joints` on `main`.
* Follow-ups: Replace mock hardware plugin with real HW interface when ready; validate with controller manager on device.

* 2025-09-07 / agent: codex-cli
* Phase / Subsystem: Tests / Utilities
* Task: Add math utilities + unit tests
* Summary: Implemented `lib/math_utils.py` (ticks→m/s, angle wrap to [-pi, pi), clamp) and added `tests/unit/test_math_utils.py`; ensured import path in tests works without packaging.
* Acceptance: Local `pytest` now 16 passed; linters clean after Black formatted.
* Evidence: Commit `feat(utils): add math_utils (ticks→m/s, angle wrap, clamp) with unit tests; format code` on `main`.
* Follow-ups: Consider moving utils into a proper package later and exposing via `setup.cfg` if needed.

* 2025-09-07 / agent: codex-cli
* Phase / Subsystem: Configs & Tests / Nav2 & Launch
* Task: Add Nav2 minimal params + schema; launch dry-check test
* Summary: Added `configs/nav2/nav2_params.yaml` and `configs/schemas/nav2.schema.json`; extended `tests/config/test_yaml_schemas.py` to validate it. Added `tests/launch/test_teleop_viz_text.py` to assert required launch args/params exist without importing ROS.
* Acceptance: `pytest` local: 12 passed; linters clean (`yamllint`, `codespell`, `ruff exit-zero`, `black` formatted).
* Evidence: Commit `feat(configs): add minimal Nav2 params + JSON Schema; add launch dry-check test; improve Ansible roles...`.
* Follow-ups: Flesh out Nav2 param sets (costmaps, recoveries) later; consider making ruff non-exit-zero and enabling tests on main.

* 2025-09-07 / agent: codex-cli
* Phase / Subsystem: Bring-up / Ansible
* Task: Fill ROS 2 install steps; add LiDAR udev; set ExecStart

* Phase / Subsystem: Docs / Repo Hygiene
* Task: Keep travel plan local-only
* Summary: Removed `travel_progress_plan.md` from Git history (untracked going forward) and added it to `.gitignore`. Local working copy remains on this machine.

* Acceptance: Pass — `node -v` → v20.19.5; `codex --version` → codex-cli 0.30.0.
* Evidence: Remote install via SSH; verified binaries present in PATH (`/usr/bin/node`, `/usr/bin/codex`).

* Phase / Subsystem: Bring-up / Tooling
* Task: Configure Codex CLI auth on headless RPi
* Summary: Copied local `$HOME/.codex/auth.json` to `alpha-viam.local:~/.codex/auth.json` per headless auth docs; verified `codex login status` shows "Logged in using ChatGPT".
* Acceptance: Pass — non-interactive auth works on RPi.
* Evidence: `ssh alpha_viam@alpha-viam.local 'codex login status'` → Logged in using ChatGPT.
* Follow-ups: If preferring API key billing, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` on the RPi and run `codex login --api-key $OPENAI_API_KEY`.
