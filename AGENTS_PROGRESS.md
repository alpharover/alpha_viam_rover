What this is
A living log for agents and developers. Append a new entry each time you complete a task. Keep it short; link evidence.

Entry template

* Date / Author (agent or human)
* Phase / Subsystem
* Task ID (issue/PR) & Title
* Summary of changes
* Acceptance test result (pass/fail, brief notes)
* Evidence links (MCAP, Foxglove layout, screenshots)
* Follow‑ups / Risks

Rules

* Append only; never rewrite history.
* Reference ADR IDs for decisions.
* If a task fails acceptance, create a follow‑up issue immediately.
